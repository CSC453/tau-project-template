## Initialization

#### Fetching the shared code

After your repository is created, you need to run the following command from the repo's top-level directory to fetch the code from shared repositories:

```bash
./init.sh
```

#### Generating the stub files

Projects begin with a set of files that are auto-generated.  They are generated with the following command:

```bash
./tau/utilities/initialize.sh
```

That script is a linux/MacOS command.
